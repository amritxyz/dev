To improve your internet connection speed in Arch Linux using Hyprland, you can try several approaches:

    Update Your System: Make sure your system is up-to-date. Open a terminal and run:

    bash

sudo pacman -Syu

Network Configuration:

    Ensure you're using the right driver for your network card. You can check the current driver with:

    bash

lspci -k

Use NetworkManager or systemd-networkd to manage your connections efficiently. You can install NetworkManager if you haven't already:

bash

sudo pacman -S networkmanager

Enable and start it:

bash

    sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
    sudo systemctl start NetworkManager

DNS Settings: Switch to a faster DNS provider. You can change your DNS settings in /etc/resolv.conf or through your network manager. Consider using Google DNS or Cloudflare:

    Google DNS:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

Cloudflare:

    nameserver 1.1.1.1
    nameserver 1.0.0.1

TCP Settings: You can tweak TCP settings for better performance. Edit or create the file /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf and add:

bash

net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1

Then apply the changes:

bash

    sudo sysctl -p

    Limit Background Traffic: Ensure that no unnecessary background applications are consuming bandwidth. Use tools like nethogs to monitor which applications are using your network.

    Wired vs. Wireless: If possible, use a wired connection (Ethernet) instead of Wi-Fi, as it tends to be faster and more stable.

    QoS Settings: If you're on a router, consider configuring Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize your traffic.

    Performance Testing: Use tools like iperf or speedtest-cli to measure your internet speed before and after making changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to achieve a faster internet connection on your Arch Linux setup with Hyprland.
