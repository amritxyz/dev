%\section{Introduction}
Managing personal finances has become one of the most important skills in today's world.
People often find it challenging to keep track of their money due to multiple income
sources, daily expenses, and the growing use of digital payment methods such as credit and
debit cards, mobile wallets, online subscriptions, and shopping platforms \cite{singh2021spending}. Small, everyday
expenses like a cup of coffee, streaming subscriptions, or impulse purchases can quickly add
up and disrupt monthly budgets \cite{chandini2019online}. Without proper tracking, individuals may overspend, fail
to save, or even fall into debt. Poor financial management can also affect mental well-being,
family life, and long-term security \cite{verma2024research}. Therefore, it has become essential to adopt tools and
systems that help individuals manage their money effectively, understand spending patterns,
and plan for the future.

A personal expense tracker is a digital tool designed to simplify the management of income 
and expenditures. It allows users to record every financial transaction in an organized
manner, providing insights into how money is being spent. By using such a system, individuals
can identify areas of unnecessary spending, avoid overspending, and develop better
financial habits. Unlike traditional methods such as handwritten notes, mental accounting,
or basic spreadsheets which are prone to errors and inconsistencies, a digital expense tracker
offers categorization, and real-time analytics. It reduces human error, saves
time, and provides a reliable platform for financial management \cite{verma2024research}.

The main objective of this system is to increase financial awareness and support users in
achieving their financial goals. It helps users understand the balance between income and
expenses, highlights spending trends, and enables informed decision-making. For students,
it helps manage pocket money; for professionals, it assists in budgeting salaries and bills;
and for households, it supports managing monthly expenses efficiently. The system also
motivates users to save by providing visual evidence of their progress, such as charts and
graphs comparing spending across different categories. These visual tools make complex
financial data easy to understand, enabling users to take control of their finances and plan
for future needs.

\newpage

From a technical perspective, the project uses modern and reliable technologies to ensure
a secure, fast, and user-friendly experience. The frontend is built with React, which provides
smooth, interactive interfaces and allows for easy updates and feature expansion. The
backend is implemented using Node.js and Express, handling login, transaction processing,
and data validation efficiently. For data storage, MySQL is used due to its reliability and
suitability for structured financial data. This technology stack ensures that the system is
practical, maintainable, and accessible across multiple devices.

In addition to personal use, the system also supports business applications, such as
tracking employee expenses and budgets. Organizations can use expense tracking software
to record daily expenditures, generate reports, and analyze trends to identify cost-saving
opportunities. Automating these processes reduces manual work, increases accuracy, and
gives administrators complete visibility of financial resources. By integrating these func-
tionalities, the system can serve both individuals and organizations, helping them manage
finances in a structured and efficient way.

Overall, the Personal Expense Tracker project aims to provide a comprehensive, easy-
to-use solution for financial management. It combines the simplicity of record-keeping
with the power of automated analysis and visualization, making it easier for users to
track, understand, and control their finances. By encouraging better spending habits,
promoting savings, and providing actionable insights, the system supports financial stability
and independence for users across different age groups and professional backgrounds. With
its user-friendly design, automated features, and visual reporting, this tool not only improves
financial awareness but also fosters long-term financial discipline, helping individuals and
organizations achieve their financial objectives more effectively.

\chapter{Problem Statement}

Most individuals lack a systematic way to record and analyze their daily income and expenses.
People earn money from different sources and spend it on various needs such as food,
transportation, education, healthcare, shopping, and entertainment \cite{singh2021spending}.
Writing expenses in a diary or notebook is not very effective because it takes time, can be
forgotten, and is difficult to calculate \cite{manchanda2017expense}.

A personal expenses tracker aims to solve this problem by providing a digital platform where
users can easily record their income and expenses in a systematic way \cite{chandini2019online}.
It helps categorize transactions into groups such as food, bills, travel, or entertainment, making it
easier to understand where most of the money is going \cite{verma2024research}. It also supports better financial decision making. It also helps in making a monthly budget and set our financial goal where to spend more money
and create limit in overspending \cite{verma2024research}. Recording transaction in notebook is time-consuming ,
sometime people forget to record every expense. Some people also use spreadsheets, but it is
not very user-friendly for everyone \cite{manchanda2017expense}.

The main problem is not only recording the money but also keeping it organized, accurate, and
easy to understand. Therefore, a personal expenses tracker is very important. With this tool,
individuals can avoid overspending, save more effectively, and achieve their future financial
plans \cite{verma2024research}. \vspace{30pt}

\chapter{Objectives}
The objectives of \textbf{Personal Expense Tracker} are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbullet, topsep=2pt, partopsep=0pt, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
   \item \textbf{Enhance Accessibility and Usability}:
    Help users understand their spending habits through categorized records and visual charts.
    \item \textbf{Easy Financial Tracking}:
    Help users quickly and easily record their income and expenses in a digital way, making it simpler than writing them down in a notebook or using spreadsheets.
    \item \textbf{Better Money Decisions}: 
    Show users where their money is going through simple charts and summaries, helping them understand their spending habits and make smarter choices.
    \item \textbf{Budget and Goal Setting}:
    Let users set monthly budgets and financial goals, so they can track their spending and avoid going over budget.
\end{enumerate}

%\chapter{Literature Review}
%Many researchers and developers have studied ways to help people manage their personal finances more effectively. Traditional methods, such as writing expenses in a notebook or using basic spreadsheets, are often time-consuming, prone to mistakes, and do not provide clear insights into spending habits. To address these issues, several digital expense tracker systems have been developed.

%Mobile applications like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), and PocketGuard allow users to categorize transactions, track income and expenses, and visualize data through charts and graphs. Some studies show that using these tools helps individuals save more money, understand spending patterns, and plan budgets efficiently. Other research focuses on building simple web-based systems that provide CRUD functionality for income and expenses, making it easier for users to maintain accurate records.

%Recent research has explored innovative approaches to expense tracking.

%\cite{lusardi2014financial} demonstrated that financial literacy plays a crucial role in personal financial management and decision-making. Their study shows how understanding financial concepts can significantly improve users' ability to manage their money effectively.

%\cite{capgemini2021payments} reported on global payment trends and the increasing adoption of digital payment methods, highlighting the growing need for comprehensive expense tracking solutions in the modern financial landscape.

%\cite{bamforth2018spending} investigated the psychological aspects of small expenses, showing how micro-spending behaviors accumulate over time and impact overall financial health.

%Their research aligns with the need for modern, accessible expense tracking solutions.

%While many existing systems offer advanced features like bank integration, predictive analysis, or expense reports for organizations, these can be complex or costly for individual users. Therefore, a simpler personal expense tracker with easy data entry, category-based visualization, and optional export features can provide practical and effective support for everyday financial management.

\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Requirement identification}

\subsection{Study of an Existing System}
Today, there are many expense tracker apps and tools already available. Popular mobile apps like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), and PocketGuard help people manage their money by connecting with bank accounts, sorting expenses into categories, and showing charts of spending. Some people also use Google Sheets or other spreadsheets to record expenses, since they are free and flexible, but these require more manual work. For businesses, tools like Expensify and Zoho Expense are often used because they support features like scanning receipts, creating reports, and handling reimbursements. Even though these systems are useful, many of them are either too complex, cost money to use, or do not work well offline. This creates a need for a simple, easy-to-use expense tracker that provides only the most important features without making things complicated.

\subsection{Requirement Collection}
In the Requirement Collection phase, we gather and identify the essential features and functionalities needed for the Personal Expense Tracker system. This process involves interacting with users and understanding their needs through various methods. The goal is to ensure the system is both useful and user-friendly. \\[3mm]
