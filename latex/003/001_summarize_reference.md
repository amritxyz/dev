Here is a summary of the paper titled "Online Income and Expense Tracker" from IRJET, which can
be used as a reference for the project proposal "Personal Expense Tracker":

The paper presents an online income and expense tracker system designed to help users manage their
finances efficiently by maintaining data of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly expenses and income.
The system allows users to select expense categories, enter details such as amounts, capture photos
of bills, add location information, and save all data to a local database. It provides features for
sorting and viewing expenses over various time periods and calculates daily expenses based on the
user's income. The tracker supports unique user identification and generates reports with graphs
to provide a clear overview of income and expenses. It also includes notifications for budget
overruns and monthly expense summaries sent via email.

The system's advantages are reducing manual calculations, serving as a reminder for payments,
allowing users to attach bill images for better tracking, supporting multiple payment modes,
and managing lend/owe expenses automatically. It is developed as a web application using PHP and
offers user authentication, expense categorization, and graphical visualization of financial data.
The paper concludes that the system is more efficient than manual tracking methods and plans future
enhancements like barcode scanning to ease data entry.

This comprehensive system aims to help individuals keep track of their financial transactions,
control expenses, and plan better budgeting through integrated features and automated reminders.
