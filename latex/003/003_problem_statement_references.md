Here is the problem statement paragraph with the proper citations added and explanations for their placement:

***

Most individuals lack a systematic way to record and analyze their daily income and expenses. People
earn money from different sources and spend it on various needs such as food, transportation,
education, healthcare, shopping, and entertainment \cite{singh2021spending}. Writing expenses in
a diary or notebook is not very effective because it takes time, can be forgotten, and is difficult
to calculate \cite{manchanda2017expense}.  

A personal expenses tracker aims to solve this problem by providing a digital platform where users
can easily record their income and expenses in a systematic way \cite{chandini2019online}. It helps
categorize transactions into groups such as food, bills, travel, or entertainment, making it easier
to understand where most of the money is going \cite{verma2024research}. It also supports better
financial decision-making. It also helps in making a monthly budget and setting financial goals,
showing where to spend more money and where to create limits to avoid overspending
\cite{verma2024research}. Recording transactions in notebooks is time-consuming, and sometimes
people forget to record every expense. Some people also use spreadsheets, but it is not very
user-friendly for everyone \cite{manchanda2017expense}.  

The main problem is not only recording the money but also keeping it organized, accurate, and easy
to understand. Therefore, a personal expenses tracker is very important. With this tool,
individuals can avoid overspending, save more effectively, and achieve their future financial
plans \cite{verma2024research}.
