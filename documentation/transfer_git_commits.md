To transfer commits from a GitLab repository to a GitHub repository, you can follow these general steps: First, clone your GitLab repository locally, then add your GitHub repository as a remote, and finally push your commits to the GitHub repository. For detailed instructions, you can refer to resources that outline the process step by step. ### Step-by-Step Guide to Transfer Commits from GitLab to GitHub

#### 1. Clone Your GitLab Repository

Start by cloning your GitLab repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/amritxyz/bsd-install.git
cd bsd-install
```

#### 2. Add Your GitHub Repository as a Remote

Next, you need to add your newly created GitHub repository as a remote. This allows you to push your commits to GitHub. Run the following command:

```bash
git remote add github https://github.com/amritxyz/bsd-install.git
```

#### 3. Push Your Commits to GitHub

Now that you have added the GitHub repository as a remote, you can push your commits. Use the following command to push your main branch:

```bash
git push github main
```

If you encounter any issues during the push, you may need to check the integrity of your local repository or ensure that you have the correct permissions set up on GitHub.

#### 4. Verify the Push

After pushing, check your GitHub repository to ensure that all commits have been transferred successfully. You can do this by visiting the repository link in your browser.

#### 5. Set GitHub as Default Remote (Optional)

If you want to make GitHub your default remote for future pushes, you can remove the GitLab remote and rename the GitHub remote to `origin`:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote rename github origin
```

Now, when you run `git push`, it will default to pushing to your GitHub repository.

### Additional Notes

- **Personal Access Token**: If you have two-factor authentication enabled on GitHub, you will need to use a personal access token instead of your password when prompted during the push.
- **Commit History**: Ensure that your commit history is intact by checking the logs with:

```bash
git log
```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully transfer your commits from the GitLab repository to your GitHub repository.
