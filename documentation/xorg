To configure **`intel-media-driver`** for better performance on an Intel-based system with **Xorg** (like your Intel i7-6600U with HD 520), there are a few key settings you can optimize. These settings focus on improving GPU acceleration for media workloads, such as video playback or encoding, while also ensuring that Xorg runs efficiently.

Here’s a guide to help you configure **`intel-media-driver`** and **Xorg** for better performance:

### 1. **Install Intel Media Driver**
Ensure you have the latest **`intel-media-driver`** installed. You can do this by running the following in Void Linux:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S intel-media-driver
```

If you also need **`libva`** for VA-API support (e.g., for video decoding), install it:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S libva libva-intel-driver
```

### 2. **Check for Hardware Support (Optional)**
You can check if the **`intel-media-driver`** is working by running:

```bash
vainfo
```

This will give you information on the VA-API hardware acceleration support.

### 3. **Configure Xorg for Intel Graphics (Xorg.conf or 20-intel.conf)**

Create or modify the `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` configuration file for Intel graphics. Here are some settings to optimize performance:

#### **Example `20-intel.conf` for Better Performance:**

```bash
Section "Device"
    Identifier "Intel Graphics"
    Driver "intel"
    Option "AccelMethod" "sna"          # Use SNA (Sandybridge New Acceleration) for better performance
    Option "TearFree" "true"            # Prevent tearing in video playback (helps for smooth video)
    Option "TripleBuffer" "true"        # Enable triple buffering for better performance and smoother rendering
    Option "AccelDFS" "true"            # Enable Dynamic Frequency Scaling for power saving and performance
    Option "DRI" "3"                    # Enable the latest DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) version for improved rendering
    Option "ColorTiling" "on"           # Enable color tiling for faster memory access
    Option "HotPlug" "true"             # Enable hot-plugging of displays
EndSection
```

#### Explanation of Key Options:
- **`AccelMethod "sna"`**: SNA (Sandybridge New Acceleration) is typically the fastest method on newer Intel chips. It’s optimized for performance and efficiency, but you can try **`uxa`** if you have issues (though SNA should be preferred).
- **`TearFree "true"`**: This option can eliminate screen tearing, especially noticeable during video playback.
- **`TripleBuffer "true"`**: This enables triple buffering, which can reduce tearing and improve performance in certain situations.
- **`AccelDFS "true"`**: This allows the GPU to dynamically scale its frequency for performance or power savings.
- **`DRI "3"`**: This ensures you’re using the latest version of Direct Rendering Infrastructure for improved graphics performance.
- **`ColorTiling "on"`**: Helps improve memory access, particularly for certain workloads such as video playback.

### 4. **Xorg and `i965` / `i915` Driver Tuning (Optional)**
If you experience performance issues or artifacts, you may want to test some additional options that can be added to the `i915` module (which is the driver for Intel graphics) in the **`/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf`** configuration file.

#### Example `i915.conf` (if needed):

```bash
options i915 enable_fbc=1
options i915 lvds_downclock=1
options i915 panel_use_ssc=0
options i915 enable_psr=0
```

Here’s what the options do:
- **`enable_fbc=1`**: Enables Framebuffer Compression (FBC) to reduce power consumption and improve performance.
- **`lvds_downclock=1`**: Enables downclocking of the LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) interface for power savings.
- **`panel_use_ssc=0`**: Disables Spread Spectrum Clocking (SSC), which can sometimes cause issues with display stability.
- **`enable_psr=0`**: Disables Panel Self Refresh (PSR), which can be useful for avoiding certain display problems but may reduce power consumption.

### 5. **Ensure Proper Video Decoding with VA-API**
To make sure VA-API works optimally for hardware-accelerated video decoding, configure applications that support it (such as **VLC**, **MPV**, or **Chrome/Chromium**) to use VA-API:

#### For **MPV**:
Add the following to `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` to enable hardware acceleration:

```bash
hwdec=vaapi
vo=vaapi
```

#### For **VLC**:
Ensure that VLC uses VA-API for hardware acceleration. Go to **Preferences > Input/Codecs**, and set **Hardware-accelerated decoding** to **VA-API**.

#### For **Chrome/Chromium**:
If you use Chrome or Chromium, VA-API support can be enabled through flags:
1. Open the browser and go to `chrome://flags/`.
2. Search for **"VA-API"** and enable the option.
3. Restart the browser.

### 6. **System Tuning**
If you’re experiencing slowdowns or want to ensure that your system is running as efficiently as possible, you can also check your CPU governor settings. For performance, set it to **performance mode**:

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
```

Alternatively, you can install `cpupower` and enable it via systemd for persistent tuning.

### 7. **Optional: Use `intel_gpu_tools` for Diagnostics**
To diagnose issues and monitor Intel GPU performance, you can install the **`intel_gpu_tools`** package:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S intel-gpu-tools
```

You can use the `intel_gpu_top` tool to monitor GPU usage and performance.

---

By applying these settings, you should achieve better overall performance and stability when using **`intel-media-driver`** with **Xorg** on your Intel i7-6600U with HD 520. Make sure to test different combinations of the options, as results can vary depending on specific workloads or applications.
